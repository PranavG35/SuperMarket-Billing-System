# SuperMarket-Billing-System
This project is a console-based shop management system that allows users to manage products and orders using object-oriented programming and data structures in C++. It features an **Administrator** section where products can be added, modified, or deleted, and a **Customer** section where users can place orders and view available products. The system stores product data, handles order processing with discounts, and generates invoices with detailed breakdowns. The user interface is designed to be clear and user-friendly, incorporating structured menus, aligned tables, and formatted output for a professional look. This project demonstrates the practical application of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in a real-world scenario.
